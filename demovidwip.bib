abstract = {Generative image AI has sparked heated discussion among creative professionals. However, how it might be a tool for design practice is understudied, and it is not yet understood how designers may find image AI helpful across the stages of design practice. To address this, our preliminary study explores how designers use generative image AI accompanied by design sketches to inform early-stage 3D design. Further, we also examine the perceived limitations of text-to-image models. To do this, we recruited 11 Architecture graduate students with a median work experience of 2 years. Participants completed a design task using generative image AI packages and incorporated design sketches as inputs. The study findings provide insights into how image AI can or can not be a valuable resource for architectural design practitioners. Further, findings suggest possible directions for future image AI-assisted design tools and workflows.},

abstract = {Sidewalk robots are becoming increasingly common worldwide, yet their operation on public walkways presents challenges for pedestrians. This is especially true for people with motor disabilities (PWMD) who already manage obstacles such as inadequate ramps and public incivility. The addition of sidewalk robots could further intensify these difficulties, which poses an urgent need to examine how the design of sidewalk robots may influence the daily navigation experiences of PWMD. This poster illustrates findings from semi-structured interviews with ten PWMD, providing insights into their perspectives on the presence of sidewalk robots. The study uncovers potential conflicts in shared sidewalk use and the adaptive actions PWMD described needing to undertake in response. Interviewees raised concerns about whether the robots could accommodate the needs of PWMD, as compared to people walking on foot, and the repercussions of any shortcomings in this regard. Our research also examines tensions stemming from different robotic design choices, indicating the necessity for more accessible public robot designs. We further delve into PWMD’s interaction needs and modalities for routine operation and in the event of robot malfunction. As cities increasingly allow for the deployment of robots in public spaces, this work seeks to inform equitable design and deployment guidelines for sidewalk robots and calls for further research into the implications of the rise of public robots for the diverse populations that make up any given municipality.},
