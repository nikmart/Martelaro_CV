abstract = {This paper examines sensor fusion techniques for modeling opportunities for proactive speech-based in-car interfaces. We leverage the Is Now a Good Time (INAGT) dataset, which consists of automotive, physiological, and visual data collected from drivers who self-annotated responses to the question "Is now a good time?," indicating the opportunity to receive non-driving information during a 50-minute drive. We augment this original driver-annotated data with third-party annotations of perceived safety, in order to explore potential driver overconfidence. We show that fusing automotive, physiological, and visual data allows us to predict driver labels of availability, achieving an 0.874 F1-score by extracting statistically relevant features and training with our proposed deep neural network, PazNet. Using the same data and network, we achieve an 0.891 F1-score for predicting third-party labeled safe moments. We train these models to avoid false positives---determinations that it is a good time to interrupt when it is not---since false positives may cause driver distraction or service deactivation by the driver. Our analyses show that conservative models still leave many moments for interaction and show that most inopportune moments are short. This work lays a foundation for using sensor fusion models to predict when proactive speech systems should engage with drivers.},

ABSTRACT = {Sidewalk delivery robots are being deployed as a form of last-mile delivery. While many such robots have been deployed on college campuses, fewer have been piloted on public sidewalks. Furthermore, there have been few observational studies of robots and their interactions with pedestrians. To better understand how sidewalk robots might integrate into public spaces, the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania conducted a pilot of sidewalk delivery robots to understand possible uses and the challenges that could arise in interacting with people in the city. Our team conducted ethnographic observations and intercept interviews to understand how residents perceived of and interacted with sidewalk delivery robots over the course of the public pilot. We found that people with limited knowledge about the robots crafted stories about their purpose and function. We observed the robots causing distractions and obstructions with different sidewalk users (including children and dogs), witnessed people helping immobilized robots, and learned about potential accessibility issues that the robots may pose. Based on our findings, we contribute a set of recommendations for future pilots, as well as questions to guide future design for robots in public spaces.},

abstract = {The maker movement embodies a resurgence in DIY creation, merging physical craftsmanship and arts with digital technology support. However, mere technological skills and creativity are insufficient for economically and psychologically sustainable practice. By illuminating and smoothing the path from "maker" to "maker entrepreneur," we can help broaden the viability of making as a livelihood. Our research centers on makers who design, produce, and sell physical goods. In this work, we explore the transition to entrepreneurship for these makers and how technology can facilitate this transition online and offline. We present results from interviews with 20 USA-based maker entrepreneurs (i.e., lamps, stickers), six creative service entrepreneurs (i.e., photographers, fabrication), and seven support personnel (i.e., art curator, incubator director). Our findings reveal that many maker entrepreneurs 1) are makers first and entrepreneurs second; 2) struggle with business logistics and learn business skills as they go; and 3) are motivated by non-monetary values. We discuss training and technology-based design implications and opportunities for addressing challenges in developing economically sustainable businesses around making.},

abstract = {In North America, bus operators are essential but undervalued public servants â€” the ''human infrastructure'' of public transit. Transit workers face a range of largely invisible health and safety issues that have worsened in recent years. As more attention is directed toward new technologies being commercialized in the sector these operational challenges remain largely unaddressed. Our paper contributes to a turn ''back to labor'' and describes issues bus operators face on the job. Through a diary study of bus operators' working conditions we detail how punctuated moments of workplace violence, inhumane scheduling, and unsafe operational conditions become prolonged infrastructural failure. We outline how CSCW researchers and practitioners can contribute to the design of transit systems that enhance worker dignity and contribute to ongoing efforts to address urgent health and safety concerns.},
