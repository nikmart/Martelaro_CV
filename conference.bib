abstract = { A key task in design work is grasping the client’s implicit tastes. Designers often do this based on a set of examples from the client. However, recognizing a common pattern among many intertwining variables such as color, texture, and layout and synthesizing them into a composite preference can be challenging. In this paper, we leverage the pattern recognition capability of computational models to aid in this task. We offer a set of principles for computationally learning personal style. The principles are manifested in PseudoClient, a deep learning framework that learns a computational model for personal graphic design style from only a handful of examples. In several experiments, we found that PseudoClient achieves a 79.40\% accuracy with only five positive and negative examples, outperforming several alternative methods. Finally, we discuss how PseudoClient can be utilized as a building block to support the development of future design applications.},

abstract = { Training AI systems requires large datasets. While there are a range of existing methods for collecting such data, such as paid work on crowdsourcing platforms, the strengths and weaknesses of each method leads us to believe that new, complementary methods are needed. The Polyphonic project contributes a novel method for collecting real-world data by piggybacking on game streaming communities such as Twitch, which capture over a trillion minutes of viewer attention a year. By embedding activities within the sociotechnical context of the stream, we can leverage some of this attention for data collection and processing. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept system for collecting home audio data. We conducted a field study in four live streams and found that our proof-of-concept effectively supports data capture. We also contribute further design insights about stream-based data collection systems.},

abstract = {Exploratory prototyping techniques are critical to devising new robot forms, actions, and behaviors, and to eliciting human responses to designed interactive features, early in the design process. In this opinion piece, we establish the contribution of exploratory prototyping to the field of human-robot interaction, arguing research engaged in design exploration-rather than controlled experimentation-should be focused on flexibility rather than specificity, possibility rather than replicability, and design insights as incubated subjectively through the designer rather than dispassionately proven by statistical analysis. We draw on literature in HCI for examples of published design explorations in academic venues, and to suggest how analogous contributions can be valued and evaluated by the HRI community. Lastly, we present and examine case studies of three design methods we have used in our own design work: physical prototyping with human-in-the-loop control, video prototyping, and virtual simulations.},
